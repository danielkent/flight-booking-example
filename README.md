# Flight booking system

In the class, we developed a UML class diagram for a simple flight booking
system. This repository contains the code corresponding to that UML class
digram. 

The project is split into two modules (or packages), one that handles flight
information and the other that handles booking information.

Each package is unit tested independently, then we add integration testing for
combined testing of the two packages, and finally system testing for the testing
of the complete product.
